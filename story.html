           <p id="about"> Ooh Aah Records is one of the many vinyl record stores that have sprung up in Denmark. 44 year old Tim Rose is the owner and he is quite unique in his profession. In his shop, located on Ryesgade in the Østerbro district of Copenhagen, you will find everything from Latin to soul to electronic and his prices are reasonable.</p><br> <p id="about">I think vinyl is a kind of backlash. When you stream music, then it’s like nothing. There’s nothing physically there. It has to all take place on a screen, but vinyl records force you to slow down and get engaged.</p>

          <a id="about2">"I have always been interested in music and began collecting records in the mid 80’s. In the 90’s I lived in LA. When I returned home in early 2000, it became more than just an interest in music. I became much more serious about it. I began to scavenge wildly and took an extreme interest in flea markets." — Tim, owner of "Ooh aah records" </a>
